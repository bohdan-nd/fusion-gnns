## Overview

Implementation of "Towards Efficient Fusion for Graph Neural Networks"

## Background

Humans experience the world around them from multiple sensory modalities. Since
real-world data is quite often multimodal, understanding different modalities
is meaningful for ML models. Although both Multimodal deep learning and
Graph Machine Learning has significantly developed in recent years, but multimodal
learning with graphs was not been fully explored. In this paper, we transfer
the idea of fusion to graphs and create a universal framework for fusion among
multiple entities. Since interaction between a few graphs commonly occurs in Drug
Discovery, we evaluate our framework on drug pair scoring tasks ( drug synergy
prediction and drug-drug interaction). Our method reached state-of-the-art results
on the Oâ€™Neil dataset on Bliss, Loewe, HSA, and ZIP synergy scores with much
fewer parameters in comparison with the previous solutions.
